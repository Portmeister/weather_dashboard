# Weather Dashboard

# Task Objective:
Aimed at assisting travelers who want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly. Create a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Weather data for cities is retrieved from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and is used in the context of creating this application. The third-party API allows developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to the URL & `localStorage` is used to store persistent data.. 

# Acceptance Criteria:
Weather dashboard uses form input to search for a city, and user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. Current weather conditions for that city presents the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. UV index presents a color that indicates conditions as favorable, moderate, or severe. Future weather conditions for that city
are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. When a city in the search history is clicked, user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city and when the weather dashboard is opened, user is presented with the last searched city forecast.
